My main research is on numerical optimization: theory, algorithms, and applications. I am currently focusing on efficient methods (both deterministic and stochastic), with applications in machine learning and data science.

Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at university of Helsinki, Finland, working in the department of Mathematics and Statistics with [Tuomo Valkonen](https://tuomov.iki.fi).


## Area of intrerest:
I am broadly interested in exploring the following areas:

**Optimization**
- Efficient methods for (non)convex problems, (non)smooth formulations
- Structure-exploiting methods (sparsity, stochasticity)
- Second and higher-order optimization methods
- Online optimization

**Machine Learning**
- Applications of optimization in machine learning
- Distributed and Federated learning
- Communication- and computation-efficient algorithms

I defended my Ph.D thesis in May 2024, supervised by [Ion Necoara](https://acse.pub.ro/index.php/en/ion-necoara/), within the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) as an Early Stage Researcher, [TraDE-OPT H2020 ITN](https://trade-opt-itn.eu) project, as [ESR 10](https://trade-opt-itn.eu/ESRs/nabou). My thesis "[Higher-order methods for composite optimization and applications](https://github.com/Yassine-Nabou/Yassine-Nabou.github.io/blob/main/Yassine_nabou_PHD.pdf)", focuses on advanced optimization techniques and their applications. 


I received a BSc degree in Applied Mathematics from [University Cadi Ayyad](https://www.uca.ma) in 2016. I obtained a MSc degree in Applied mathematics from [Faculty of Science and Technology](https://www.fsts.ac.ma), Morocco in 2018.
