I am a  research in Computational Mathematics with a focus on Numerical Optimization and Machine Learning. Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at university of Helsinki, Finland, working in the department of Mathematics and Statistics with [Tuomo Valkonen](https://tuomov.iki.fi).


## Area of intrerest:
- Optimization: Theory and algorithms with a focus on structure exploitation, sparsity, convexity, stochasticity, and low-rank optimization.
- Development of efficient methods for convex and non-convex problem classes, including smooth and nonsmooth formulations.
- Second-order optimization techniques for machine learning and applications in power flow analysis, phase retrieval, and control problems.
- Online optimization with a specific interest in bilevel optimization settings.

I defended my Ph.D thesis in May, 2024 supervised by [Ion Necoara](https://acse.pub.ro/index.php/en/ion-necoara/) within the [TraDE-Opt](https://trade-opt-itn.eu) project. My thesis is "Higher-order methods for composite optimization and applications".
