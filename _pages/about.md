I am an applied scientist and researcher working at the intersection of numerical optimization and machine learning. My work spans optimization theory, algorithm design, and scalable implementations, with a focus on both convex and non-convex problems.

I specialize in bridging mathematical foundations with practical, high-performance solutions, developing efficient methods that improve the speed, robustness, and scalability of machine learning models.

I am interested in applying optimization-driven approaches to complex R&D challenges in areas such as AI, energy systems, and large-scale decision-making.

**Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at university of Helsinki, Finland, working in the department of Mathematics and Statistics with [Tuomo Valkonen](https://tuomov.iki.fi).**


## Education & Research Background

I defended my Ph.D thesis in May 2024, supervised by [Ion Necoara](https://acse.pub.ro/index.php/en/ion-necoara/), within the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) as an Early Stage Researcher, [TraDE-OPT H2020 ITN](https://trade-opt-itn.eu) project, as [ESR 10](https://trade-opt-itn.eu/ESRs/nabou). My thesis "[Higher-order methods for composite optimization and applications](https://github.com/Yassine-Nabou/Yassine-Nabou.github.io/files/Yassine_nabou_PHD.pdf)", focuses on advanced optimization techniques and their applications. 

I received a BSc degree in Applied Mathematics from [University Cadi Ayyad](https://www.uca.ma) in 2016. I obtained a MSc degree in Applied mathematics from [Faculty of Science and Technology](https://www.fsts.ac.ma), Morocco in 2018.



## Area of intrerest:
I am broadly interested in exploring the following areas:

### Optimization
- Efficient methods for convex and nonconvex optimization, including nonsmooth formulations
- Structure-exploiting algorithms (e.g., sparsity and stochasticity)
- Second- and higher-order optimization methods
- Online optimization

### Machine Learning
- Optimization methods for machine learning
- Distributed and federated learning
- Communication- and computation-efficient algorithms
