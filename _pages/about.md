I am an applied scientist and researcher working at the intersection of numerical optimization and machine learning. My work spans optimization theory, algorithm design, and scalable implementations, with a focus on both convex and nonconvex problems.
I specialize in bridging mathematical foundations with practical, high-performance solutions, developing efficient methods that improve the speed, robustness, and scalability of machine learning models.
I am interested in applying optimization-driven approaches to complex R&D challenges in areas such as AI, energy systems, and large-scale decision-making.

**Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, Finland, in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, working with [Tuomo Valkonen](https://tuomov.iki.fi).**


## Education & Research Background

I defended my Ph.D thesis in May 2024, supervised by [Ion Necoara](https://acse.pub.ro/index.php/en/ion-necoara/), within the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) as an Early Stage Researcher, [TraDE-OPT H2020 ITN](https://trade-opt-itn.eu) project, as [ESR 10](https://trade-opt-itn.eu/ESRs/nabou). My thesis "Higher-order methods for composite optimization and applications", focuses on advanced optimization techniques and their applications.

I received a BSc degree in Applied Mathematics from [University Cadi Ayyad](https://www.uca.ma) in 2016. I obtained a MSc degree in Applied mathematics from [Faculty of Science and Technology](https://www.fsts.ac.ma), Morocco in 2018.



## Area of interest
I am broadly interested in exploring the following areas:

### Optimization
- Efficient convex and nonconvex optimization, including nonsmooth formulations
- Structure-aware methods (composite objectives, sparsity, stochasticity)
- Second- and higher-order methods, bilevel optimization, and online optimization

### Machine Learning
- Optimization for ML and AI
- Distributed and federated learning (including Byzantine-resilient methods)
- Communication- and computation-efficient algorithms
